# Google Drive OAuth Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up Google Drive access for the Personal RAG system using OAuth 2.0.

## Overview

The Personal RAG system uses Google OAuth 2.0 to access your Google Drive files. This is a one-time setup that allows the application to read your Drive files securely.

**Time required**: ~10 minutes

## Prerequisites

- A Google account
- Access to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click **"Select a Project"** dropdown at the top
3. Click **"New Project"**
   - **Project name**: `Personal RAG` (or any name you prefer)
   - **Location**: Leave as default (No organization)
4. Click **"Create"**
5. Wait for the project to be created (~30 seconds)
6. Select your new project from the dropdown

### 2. Enable Google Drive API

1. In the search bar at the top, type: `Google Drive API`
2. Click on **"Google Drive API"** from the results
3. Click the blue **"Enable"** button
4. Wait for the API to be enabled

### 3. Configure OAuth Consent Screen

Before creating credentials, you need to configure the OAuth consent screen:

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"OAuth consent screen"** (left sidebar)
2. Choose **"External"** as User Type
3. Click **"Create"**

**OAuth consent screen configuration:**

- **App name**: `Personal RAG`
- **User support email**: Select your email from dropdown
- **App logo**: (optional, skip for now)
- **Application home page**: (optional, skip)
- **Authorized domains**: (skip for now)
- **Developer contact information**: Enter your email

4. Click **"Save and Continue"**

**Scopes screen:**
- Click **"Add or Remove Scopes"**
- Search for `drive.readonly`
- Check the box for `.../auth/drive.readonly` (Read-only access to Drive)
- Click **"Update"**
- Click **"Save and Continue"**

**Test users:**
- Click **"Add Users"**
- Enter your Google email address
- Click **"Add"**
- Click **"Save and Continue"**

**Summary:**
- Review the summary
- Click **"Back to Dashboard"**

### 4. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to **"APIs & Services"** ‚Üí **"Credentials"** (left sidebar)
2. Click **"+ Create Credentials"** at the top
3. Select **"OAuth client ID"**
4. Choose application type: **"Desktop app"**
5. **Name**: `Personal RAG Desktop`
6. Click **"Create"**

### 5. Download Credentials

1. A popup will show your Client ID and Secret
2. Click **"Download JSON"** button (or the download icon ‚¨áÔ∏è)
3. Save the downloaded file

### 6. Install Credentials in Your Project

**Option A: Rename and move**
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
mv client_secret_*.json ~/src/personal-rag/credentials.json
```

**Option B: Copy content**
1. Open the downloaded JSON file
2. Copy all the content
3. Create `credentials.json` in your project root:
   ```bash
   cd ~/src/personal-rag
   nano credentials.json
   # Paste the JSON content
   # Press Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter to save
   ```

### 7. Verify Installation

```bash
cd ~/src/personal-rag
ls -la credentials.json
```

You should see the file listed. The credentials.json file should look like this:

```json
{
  "installed": {
    "client_id": "xxxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com",
    "project_id": "your-project",
    "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
    "token_uri": "https://oauth2.googleapis.com/token",
    "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
    "client_secret": "xxxxx",
    "redirect_uris": ["http://localhost"]
  }
}
```

## First Run: OAuth Authorization

When you first run the Google Drive ingestion, the OAuth flow will start:

### Test the Connection

```bash
# Activate your virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# List your Google Drive folders (this will trigger OAuth)
python ingest.py --source-type gdrive --list-folders
```

### What Happens Next

1. **Browser Opens**: Your default browser will open automatically
2. **Google Sign In**: Sign in with your Google account (if not already signed in)
3. **Permission Screen**: You'll see a screen saying:
   - "Personal RAG wants to access your Google Account"
   - "See and download all your Google Drive files"
4. **Warning**: You may see "Google hasn't verified this app" warning:
   - Click **"Advanced"**
   - Click **"Go to Personal RAG (unsafe)"**
   - This is normal for personal apps - you're the developer!
5. **Grant Access**: Click **"Allow"** to grant permissions
6. **Success**: You'll see "The authentication flow has completed"
7. **Close Browser**: You can close the browser tab

### Token Storage

After successful authorization:
- A `token.json` file will be created in your project root
- This stores your access token for future use
- You won't need to re-authorize unless the token expires (rare)
- **Security**: The token.json is already in .gitignore (won't be committed)

## Testing Google Drive Integration

### 1. List Folders

```bash
python ingest.py --source-type gdrive --list-folders
```

This shows all folders in your Google Drive.

### 2. Ingest a Few Files (Test)

```bash
# Ingest just 5 files to test
python ingest.py --source-type gdrive --max-results 5
```

### 3. Ingest from Specific Folder

```bash
# First, list folders to find the ID
python ingest.py --source-type gdrive --list-folders

# Copy the folder ID you want, then:
python ingest.py --source-type gdrive --folder-id "YOUR_FOLDER_ID"
```

### 4. Ingest All Accessible Files

```bash
# Ingest up to 100 files (default)
python ingest.py --source-type gdrive --max-results 100
```

### 5. Check Ingestion Stats

```bash
python ingest.py --stats
```

## Supported Google Drive File Types

The system can ingest:

- ‚úÖ **Google Docs** (exported as plain text)
- ‚úÖ **Google Sheets** (exported as CSV)
- ‚úÖ **PDFs** (text extracted)
- ‚úÖ **Word documents** (.docx)
- ‚úÖ **Plain text files** (.txt)
- ‚úÖ **Markdown files** (.md)

Files are automatically converted to text for indexing.

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "credentials.json not found"

**Solution**: Make sure credentials.json is in the project root directory:
```bash
ls -la ~/src/personal-rag/credentials.json
```

### Issue: "Access blocked: This app's request is invalid"

**Solution**:
- Make sure you configured the OAuth consent screen
- Add yourself as a test user
- Verify the Google Drive API is enabled

### Issue: "The authentication flow has completed" but script fails

**Solution**:
- Delete `token.json` and try again
- Check your internet connection
- Verify credentials.json format is correct

### Issue: "invalid_grant" error

**Solution**:
```bash
# Token expired or invalid - delete and re-authorize
rm token.json
python ingest.py --source-type gdrive --list-folders
```

### Issue: "Access denied" when trying to access files

**Solution**:
- Make sure you granted all permissions during OAuth
- Check that the scope includes `drive.readonly`
- Re-run the OAuth flow: `rm token.json` and try again

### Issue: "Rate limit exceeded"

**Solution**:
- Google Drive API has rate limits
- Reduce `--max-results` value
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- For large datasets, ingest in batches

## Security Considerations

### What You're Granting

- **Read-only access** to your Google Drive
- The app can **read** your files but **cannot modify or delete** them
- Access is limited to the account you authorize

### Credential Safety

- ‚úÖ `credentials.json` is in .gitignore (won't be committed to git)
- ‚úÖ `token.json` is in .gitignore (won't be committed to git)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never share these files publicly
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Don't commit them to version control

### Revoking Access

To revoke access at any time:

1. Go to [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
2. Find "Personal RAG" in the list
3. Click "Remove Access"
4. Delete local `token.json` file

## Alternative: Service Account (Advanced)

For server deployments or team use, consider using a Service Account instead:

1. Google Cloud Console ‚Üí "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "Service Account"
2. Download the service account JSON key
3. Share specific Drive folders with the service account email
4. Update code to use service account credentials

See [Google Service Account Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts) for details.

## Alternative: Google Drive Desktop App (Simplest)

If you prefer to avoid API setup entirely:

1. Install [Google Drive for Desktop](https://www.google.com/drive/download/)
2. Sign in and sync your files
3. Use the local file connector:
   ```bash
   python ingest.py --source "~/Google Drive/My Drive" --source-type local
   ```

This works exactly the same but requires no OAuth setup!
